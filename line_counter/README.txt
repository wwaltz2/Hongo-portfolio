hello there!

This is the file where I will explain the line_counter program.
Simply put, I made a program that would count the amount of actual lines of code in a Python file.
I have a friend who is attending the University of Wisconsin in Madison, and our
Big Ten rivalry has led to several coding challenges. More specifically, we would each make a program
(typically a cipher encoder/decoder) and see who can do it in fewer lines of code.

I have since expanded the program that attempts to count the number of lines in a C program file, though
some more work is necessary.
